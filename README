NetGWM stands for Network Gateway Manager
(http://flant.ru/projects/netgwm)

NetGWM is a tool on Python used for automatically switching
network gateway when your current ISP goes offline.

Using simple YAML configuration file (have a look at
samples/netgwm.yml), you define your gateways (by IPs or
devices) and their priorities. Then, you should add
netgwm.py to the crontab. NetGWM will ping given addresses
through your current gateway to check your Internet
connection. If all of these addresses are down, NetGWM will
switch your current gateway to a working one (with a highest
priority).

Other features:
* A gateway is considered as working only after N seconds
  of successfull checks. This setting ("min_uptime") can be
  configured in netgwm.yml.
* When a gateway with a higher priority goes back online
  NetGWM will automatically switch to it from the current
  one.
* Every time NetGWM switches a network gateway, it will
  execute all the scripts placed in
  /etc/netgwm/post-replace.d (for more details, please have
  a look at samples/post-replace.d/script.sh).
* NetGWM can maintain the full list of gateways statuses
  continually for your special needs (e.g. to be used in
  other software). This data is stored in
  /var/run/netgwm/gwstore.yml. This setting
  ("check_all_gateways") can be enabled in netgwm.yml.
