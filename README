NetGWM stands for Network Gateway Manager
(http://flant.ru/projects/netgwm)

NetGWM is a tool on Python used for automatically switching
network gateway when your current ISP goes offline.

Using simple YAML configuration file (have a look at
samples/netgwm.yml), you define your gateways (by IPs or
devices) and their priorities. Then, you should netgwm.py
to the crontab. NetGWM will ping given addresses through
your current gateway to check your Internet connection.
If all of these addresses are down - NetGWM will switch
your current to a working one (with a highest priority).
